abstract = {We propose a CFD-based approach for the non-invasive hemodynamic assessment of pre- and post-operative coarctation of aorta (CoA) patients. Under our approach, the pressure gradient across the coarctation is determined from computational modeling based on physiological principles, medical imaging data, and routine non-invasive clinical measurements. The main constituents of our approach are a reduced-order model for computing blood flow in patient-specific aortic geometries, a parameter estimation procedure for determining patient-specific boundary conditions and vessel wall parameters from non-invasive measurements, and a comprehensive pressure-drop formulation coupled with the overall reduced-order model. The proposed CFD-based algorithm is fully automatic, requiring no iterative tuning procedures for matching the computed results to observed patient data, and requires approximately 6-8 min of computation time on a standard personal computer (Intel Core2 Duo CPU, 3.06 GHz), thus making it feasible for use in a clinical setting. The initial validation studies for the pressure-drop computations have been performed on four patient datasets with native or recurrent coarctation, by comparing the results with the invasively measured peak pressure gradients recorded during routine cardiac catheterization procedure. The preliminary results are promising, with a mean absolute error of less than 2 mmHg in all the patients.},

abstract = {Parallel computers have demonstrated a remarkable potential for achieving high performance at a reasonable cost for many computer vision and image processing (CVIP) applications. A major obstacle to the use of parallel computers is the lack of a universally accepted metric to study the scalability of parallel algorithms and architectures. The authors apply different scalability measures to various 2-D FFT algorithms and target architectures and compare the expected performance to the measured results. A number of algorithms in computer vision and image processing exhibit regular communication patterns similar to the 2-D FFT. The authors can therefore extrapolate the observations to determine which aspects of these measures are relevant to the scalability analysis of other similar image processing algorithms},

abstract = {Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2-4], and journal [5, 6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8-11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17\% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working e-mail address for the first, last, or corresponding author fell by 7\% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a survey of the different parallel programming models and tools available today with special consideration to their suitability for high-performance computing. Thus, we review the shared and distributed memory approaches, as well as the current heterogeneous parallel programming model. In addition, we analyze how the partitioned global address space (PGAS) and hybrid parallel programming models are used to combine the advantages of shared and distributed memory systems. The work is completed by considering languages with specific parallel support and the distributed programming paradigm. In all cases, we present characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. The study shows that the availability of multi-core CPUs has given new impulse to the shared memory parallel programming approach. In addition, we find that hybrid parallel programming is the current way of harnessing the capabilities of computer clusters with multi-core nodes. On the other hand, heterogeneous programming is found to be an increasingly popular paradigm, as a consequence of the availability of multi-core CPUs+GPUs systems. The use of open industry standards like OpenMP, MPI, or OpenCL, as opposed to proprietary solutions, seems to be the way to uniformize and extend the use of parallel programming models.},

abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a term applied to large, hosted datacenters, usually geographically distributed, which offer various computational services on a ldquoutilityrdquo basis. Most typically the configuration and provisioning of these datacenters, as far as the services for the subscribers go, is highly automated, to the point of the service being delivered within seconds of the subscriber request. Additionally, the datacenters typically use hypervisor based virtualization as a technique to deliver these services. The concept of a cloud operated by one service provider or enterprise interoperating with a clouds operated by another is a powerful idea. So far that is limited to use cases where code running on one cloud explicitly references a service on another cloud. There is no implicit and transparent interoperability. Use cases for interoperability, as well as work-in-progress around inter-cloud protocols and formats for enabling those use cases, are discussed in this paper.},

Unfortunately, once a workflow application has been designed in one particular system it becomes very hard to share it with users working with different systems. Portability of workflows and interoperability between current systems barely exists. In this work, we present the fine-grained interoperability solution proposed in the SHIWA European project that brings together four representative European workflow systems: ASKALON, MOTEUR, WS-PGRADE, and Triana. The proposed interoperability is realised at two levels of abstraction: abstract and concrete. At the abstract level, we propose a generic Interoperable Workflow Intermediate Representation (IWIR) that can be used as a common bridge for translating workflows between different languages independent of the underlying distributed computing infrastructure. At the concrete level, we propose a bundling technique that aggregates the abstract IWIR representation and concrete task representations to enable workflow instantiation, execution and scheduling. We illustrate case studies using two real-workflow applications designed in a native environment and then translated and executed by a foreign workflow system in a foreign distributed computing infrastructure.},

abstract = {From the Summary of the Book: This book, Grid Computing: Making the Global Infrastructure a Reality, [1] brings together many of the major projects that are driving and shaping an emerging global Grid. In the chapters of this book you will find the perspectives of a pioneering group of Grid developers, researchers and application scientists whose vision forms the present and provides a view into the future of Grid computing. Many of the chapters in this book provide definitions and characterizations of the Grid – peruse these and you will form your own view. Common to all perspectives is the notion that the Grid supports the integration of resources (computers, networks, data archives, instruments etc.). To build an integrated system, individuals and communities are working in coordination to ensure that the large and complex system of Grid software will be robust, useful, and provide an interoperable collection of services that support large-scale distributed computing and data management. Grids are intrinsically distributed and heterogeneous but must be viewed by the user (whether an individual or another computer) as a virtual environment with uniform access to resources. Much of Grid software technology addresses the issues of resource schedul- ing, quality of service, fault tolerance, decentralized control and security and so on, which enable the Grid to be perceived as a single virtual platform by the user. For example, Grid security technologies must ensure that a single sign-on will generate security credentials that can be used for the many different actions (potentially on multiple resources) that may be needed in a Grid session. For some researchers and developers, the Grid is viewed as the future of the Web or Internet computing. The Web largely consists of individuals talking independently to servers; the Grid provides a collection of servers and clients often work- ing collectively together to solve a problem. Computer-to-computer traffic is characteristic of Grids and both exploits and drives the increasing network backbone bandwidth. The term Grid was originally used in analogy to other infrastructure (such as electrical power) grids.We will see in this book that the analogy correctly characterizes some aspects of Grid Computing (ubiquity, for example), but not others (the performance variability of different resources that can support the same code, for example).},

@article{Burkhoff1993,
abstract = {One of the most important consequences of acute left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is pulmonary edema resulting from a rise in pulmonary venous pressure (PVP). It is generally believed that the PVP rise is a direct hemodynamic consequence of LVD. While this paradigm seems plausible, especially if the LV is viewed as a sump pump, there is no specific evidence to support this simple explanation. A theoretical analysis was performed to assess the hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for the dramatic rise in PVP after acute LVD. The ventricles were modeled as time-varying elastances; pulmonary and systemic vascular systems were modeled as series of resistive and capacitive elements. In response to a 50\% decrease in LV contractile strength [end-systolic elastance (Ees)], cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped substantially, while PVP increased minimally from its baseline of 12 to approximately 15 mmHg. With LV Ees set at 50\% of normal, the effects of sympathetic activation were tested. When heart rate and total peripheral resistance were increased, CO and MAP improved, yet PVP still did not rise. The only intervention that caused a substantial increase in PVP was to simulate the decrease in unstressed volume (VU) of the venous system known to occur with sympathetic activation. When VU was decreased by about 15-20\% (comparable to experimentally observed shifts with acute heart failure), PVP increased above 25 mmHg. The effects of pericardial constraints were investigated, and the results suggest a major role of this organ in determining the overall hemodynamic response to acute LVD, sympathetic activation, and explaining the responses to therapy. Thus this analysis suggests that elevations of PVP do not occur simply as a direct hemodynamic consequence of acute LVD. Rather, changes in PVP may be dictated more by sympathetic control on venous capacity. If confirmed, recognition of this as a primary mechanism may prove important in directing development of new therapies and in understanding the mechanisms of disease progression in heart failure.},

abstract = {Conventional resource management systems use a system model to describe resources and a centralized scheduler to control their allocation. We argue that this paradigm does not adapt well to distributed systems, particularly those built to support high throughput computing. Obstacles include heterogeneity of resources, which make uniform allocation algorithms difficult to formulate, and distributed ownership, leading to widely varying allocation policies. Faced with these problems, we developed and implemented the classified advertisement (classad) matchmaking framework, a flexible and general approach to resource management in distributed environment with decentralized ownership of resources. Novel aspects of the framework include a semi structured data model that combines schema, data, and query in a simple but powerful specification language, and a clean separation of the matching and claiming phases of resource allocation. The representation and protocols result in a robust, scalable and flexible framework that can evolve with changing resources. The framework was designed to solve real problems encountered in the deployment of Condor, a high throughput computing system developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Condor is heavily used by scientists at numerous sites around the world. It derives much of its robustness and efficiency from the matchmaking architecture},

abstract = {Many scenarios in medical research are predestined for grid computing. Large amounts of data in complex medical image, biosignal and genome processing demand large computing power and data storage. Integration of distributed, heterogeneous data, e.g. correlation between phenotype and genotype data are playing an essential part in life sciences. Sharing of specialized software, data and processing results for collaborative work are further tasks which would strongly benefit from the use of grid infrastructures. However, two major barriers are identified in existing grid environments that prevent extensive use within the life sciences community: Extended security requirements and appropriate usability. To meet these requirements, the MediGRID project is enhancing the basic D-Grid infrastructure along with the implementation of prototype applications from different fields of biomedical research. In this paper, we focus on the developments for ease-of-use under consideration of different aspects of security. They encompass not only security within the grid infrastructure, but also the boundary conditions of network security on the site of the research institutions. For medical grids, we propose a strictly web-portal-based access to grid resources for end-users, with user-guiding, application specific, graphical interfaces. Different levels of authorization are implemented, from fully authorized users to guests without certificate authentication in order to allow hands-on experience for potential grid users. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The encouraging results of volunteer computing projects in this context and the flexibility of the cloud, suggested to address our research efforts towards a combined new computing paradigm we named Cloud@Home.On one hand it can be considered as a generalization of the @homephilosophy, knocking down the barriers of volunteer computing, and also allowing to share more general services. On the other hand, Cloud@Home can be considered as the enhancement of the grid-utility vision of cloud computing. In this new paradigm, userspsila hosts are not passive interface to cloud services anymore, but they can interact (free or by charge) with other clouds. In this paper we present the Cloud@Home paradigm, highlighting its contribution to the actual state of the art on the topic of distributed and cloud computing. We detail the functional architecture and the core structure implementing such paradigm, demonstrating how it is really possible to build up a Cloud@Home infrastructure.},

abstract = {Managing the overwhelming numbers of molecular states and interactions is a fundamental obstacle to building predictive models of biological systems. Here we introduce the Network-Free Stochastic Simulator (NFsim), a general-purpose modeling platform that overcomes the combinatorial nature of molecular interactions. Unlike standard simulators that represent molecular species as variables in equations, NFsim uses a biologically intuitive representation: objects with binding and modification sites acted on by reaction rules. During simulations, rules operate directly on molecular objects to produce exact stochastic results with performance that scales independently of the reaction network size. Reaction rates can be defined as arbitrary functions of molecular states to provide powerful coarse-graining capabilities, for example to merge Boolean and kinetic representations of biological networks. NFsim enables researchers to simulate many biological systems that were previously inaccessible to general-purpose software, as we illustrate with models of immune system signaling, microbial signaling, cytoskeletal assembly and oscillating gene expression.},

All model details, including variables, parameters, and quantitative relationships, are described in Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. The executable (HumMod.exe) parses the XML and displays the results of the physiological simulations. The XML description of physiology in HumMod's modeling environment allows investigators to add detailed descriptions of human physiology to test new concepts. Additional or revised XML content is parsed and incorporated into the model. The model accurately predicts both qualitative and quantitative changes in clinical and experimental responses. The model is useful in understanding proposed physiological mechanisms and physiological interactions that are not evident, allowing one to observe higher level emergent properties of the complex physiological systems. HumMod has many uses, for instance, analysis of renal control of blood pressure, central role of the liver in creating and maintaining insulin resistance, and mechanisms causing orthostatic hypotension in astronauts. Users simulate different physiological and pathophysiological situations by interactively altering numerical parameters and viewing time-dependent responses. HumMod provides a modeling environment to understand the complex interactions of integrative physiology. HumMod can be downloaded at http://hummod.org.},

abstract = {One of the primary outputs of the scientific enterprise is data, but many institutions such as libraries that are charged with preserving and disseminating scholarly output have largely ignored this form of documentation of scholarly activity. This paper focuses on a particularly troublesome class of data, termed dark data. “Dark data” is not carefully indexed and stored so it becomes nearly invisible to scientists and other potential users and therefore is more likely to remain underutilized and eventually lost. The article discusses how the concepts from long-tail economics can be used to understand potential solutions for better curation of this data. The paper describes why this data is critical to scientific progress, some of the properties of this data, as well as some social and technical barriers to proper management of this class of data. Many potentially useful institutional, social, and technical solutions are under development and are introduced in the last sections of the paper, but these solutions are largely unproven and require additional research and development.},

Computer simulations of this model result in vital signs that are close to target hemodynamic variables. Simulated systemic arterial pressure waveform and left ventricular pressure-volume loop are realistic, and the system reacts appropriately to blood loss. We also adapt the model structure and change its parameters to reflect the congenital heart defects: patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, complex coarctation of the aorta with patent foramen ovale, and transposition of the great arteries. Simulated vital signs are again close to target hemodynamic variables. The resulting model for neonatal cardiovascular pathophysiology is an essential step in attaining a full-body, model-driven neonatal acute care simulator.},

These applications use high-speed networks to integrate supercomputers, large databases, archival storage devices, advanced visualization devices, and/or scientific instruments to form networked virtual supercomputers or metacomputers. While the physical infrastructure to build such systems is becoming widespread, the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the metacomputing environment poses new challenges for developers of system software, parallel tools, and applications. In this article, we introduce Globus, a system that we are developing to address these challenges. The Globus system is intended to achieve a vertically integrated treatment of application, middleware, and network. A low-level toolkit provides basic mechanisms such as communication, authentication, network information, and data access. These mechanisms are used to construct various higher-level metacomputing services, such as parallel programming tools and schedulers. Our long-term goal is to build an Adaptive Wide Area Resource Environment (AWARE), an integrated set of higher-level services that enable applications to adapt to heterogeneous and dynamically changing metacomputing environments. Preliminary versions of Globus components were deployed successfully as part of the I-WAY networking experiment. 1},

To examine the importance of ventricular interdependence in controlling the circulation, we developed a computer model in which ventricular interdependence could be turned on and off. Left ventricular chamber contractility, as judged by maximal elastance (Emax), was enhanced on the order of 10\% as a result of ventricular interaction, whereas right ventricular Emax was affected by as much as 60\% under physiological conditions. With increases in systemic vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a smaller stroke volume (SV) decrease than with no interaction. For canine data (SV = 21.4 ml), doubling systemic vascular resistance decreased SV by 3.7 without ventricular interdependence, 3.5 with diastolic ventricular interdependence, and 3.3 ml with diastolic and systolic ventricular interdependence. In contrast, with increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a greater decrease in SV than with no interaction present. Decreasing left ventricular free wall elastance or right ventricular free wall elastance decreased SV. Diastolic ventricular interdependence reduced the SV changes, whereas systolic ventricular interdependence accentuated the SV changes with alterations in right and left ventricular free-wall elastance. The results of the present simulation demonstrate the importance of ventricular interdependence in the observed responses of the right ventricle to volume overload, pressure overload, and ischemia.},

Loosely coupled problems are very important in many scientific fields, and with the ongoing move towards data-intensive computing, they are on the rise. There exist several different approaches to leveraging clouds and cloud-oriented data processing frameworks to perform pleasingly parallel (also called embarrassingly parallel) computations. In this paper, we present three pleasingly parallel biomedical applications: (i) assembly of genome fragments; (ii) sequence alignment and similarity search; and (iii) dimension reduction in the analysis of chemical structures, which are implemented utilizing a cloud infrastructure service-based utility computing models of Amazon Web Services (http://Amazon.com Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) and Microsoft Windows Azure (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) as well as utilizing MapReduce-based data processing frameworks Apache Hadoop (Apache Software Foundation, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and Microsoft DryadLINQ. We review and compare each of these frameworks, performing a comparative study among them based on performance, cost, and usability. High latency, eventually consistent cloud infrastructure service-based frameworks that rely on off-the-node cloud storage were able to exhibit performance efficiencies and scalability comparable to the MapReduce-based frameworks with local disk-based storage for the applications considered. In this paper, we also analyze variations in cost among the different platform choices (e.g., Elastic Compute Cloud instance types), highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate platform based on the nature of the computation.

abstract = {Genetic algorithms were developed initially by Holland et al. in the 1960s and 1970s!!! Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and is Director of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.},

Although @neurIST targets the investigation and treatment of cerebral aneurysms, the system's architecture is generic enough that it could be adapted to the treatment of other diseases. Innovations in @neurIST include confining the patient data pertaining to aneurysms inside a single environment that offers clinicians the tools to analyze and interpret patient data and make use of knowledge-based guidance in planning their treatment. Medical researchers gain access to a critical mass of aneurysm related data due to the system's ability to federate distributed information sources.

abstract = {Deterministic dynamic models of complex biological systems contain a large number of parameters and state variables, related through nonlinear differential equations with various types of feedback. A metamodel of such a dynamic model is a statistical approximation model that maps variation in parameters and initial conditions (inputs) to variation in features of the trajectories of the state variables (outputs) throughout the entire biologically relevant input space. A sufficiently accurate mapping can be exploited both instrumentally and epistemically. Multivariate regression methodology is a commonly used approach for emulating dynamic models. However, when the input-output relations are highly nonlinear or non-monotone, a standard linear regression approach is prone to give suboptimal results. We therefore hypothesised that a more accurate mapping can be obtained by locally linear or locally polynomial regression. We present here a new method for local regression modelling, Hierarchical Cluster-based PLS regression (HC-PLSR), where fuzzy C-means clustering is used to separate the data set into parts according to the structure of the response surface. We compare the metamodelling performance of HC-PLSR with polynomial partial least squares regression (PLSR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on various systems: six different gene regulatory network models with various types of feedback, a deterministic mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock and a model of the mouse ventricular myocyte function.},

Specifically, we document a stepwise parameter estimation process, explicit simplifying assumptions, and sources for these parameters.

abstract = {Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a new tracer imaging modality that is gaining significant interest from NMR and MRI researchers. While the physics of MPI differ substantially from MRI, it employs hardware and imaging concepts that are familiar to MRI researchers, such as magnetic excitation and detection, pulse sequences, and relaxation effects. Furthermore, MPI employs the same superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) contrast agents that are sometimes used for MR angiography and are often used for MRI cell tracking studies. These SPIOs are much safer for humans than iodine or gadolinium, especially for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. The weak kidneys of CKD patients cannot safely excrete iodine or gadolinium, leading to increased morbidity and mortality after iodinated X-ray or CT angiograms, or after gadolinium-MRA studies. Iron oxides, on the other hand, are processed in the liver, and have been shown to be safe even for CKD patients. Unlike the "black blood" contrast generated by SPIOs in MRI due to increased T2 dephasing, SPIOs in MPI generate positive, "bright blood" contrast. With this ideal contrast, even prototype MPI scanners can already achieve fast, high-sensitivity, and high-contrast angiograms with millimeter-scale resolutions in phantoms and in animals. Moreover, MPI shows great potential for an exciting array of applications, including stem cell tracking in vivo, first-pass contrast studies to diagnose or stage cancer, and inflammation imaging in vivo. So far, only a handful of prototype small-animal MPI scanners have been constructed worldwide. Hence, MPI is open to great advances, especially in hardware, pulse sequence, and nanoparticle improvements, with the potential to revolutionize the biomedical imaging field. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation, and usage of a virtual laboratory for medical image analysis. It is fully based on the Dutch grid, which is part of the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE) production infrastructure and driven by the gLite middleware. The adopted service-oriented architecture enables decoupling the user-friendly clients running on the user's workstation from the complexity of the grid applications and infrastructure. Data are stored on grid resources and can be browsed/viewed interactively by the user with the Virtual Resource Browser (VBrowser). Data analysis pipelines are described as Scufl workflows and enacted on the grid infrastructure transparently using the MOTEUR workflow management system. VBrowser plug-ins allow for easy experiment monitoring and error detection. Because of the strict compliance to the grid authentication model, all operations are performed on behalf of the user, ensuring basic security and facilitating collaboration across organizations. The system has been operational and in daily use for eight months (December 2008), with six users, leading to the submission of 9000 jobs/month in average and the production of several terabytes of data.},

@book{Saltelli2004,
abstract = {This book is a ‘primer’ in global sensitivity analysis (SA). Its am- bition is to enable the reader to apply global SA to a mathematical or computational model. It offers a description of a few selected techniques for sensitivity analysis, used for assessing the relative importance of model input factors. These techniques will answer questions of the type ‘which of the uncertain input factors is more important in determining the uncertainty in the output of interest?’ or ‘if we could eliminate the uncertainty in one of the input factors, which factor should we choose to reduce the most the variance of the output?’ Throughout this primer, the input factors of interest will be those that are uncertain, i.e. whose value lie within a finite interval of non-zero width. As a result, the reader will not find sensitivity analysis methods here that look at the local property of the input–output relationships, such as derivative-based analysis1. Special attention is paid to the selection of the method, to the fram- ing of the analysis and to the interpretation and presentation of the results. The examples will help the reader to apply the methods in a way that is unambiguous and justifiable, so as to make the sensitiv- ity analysis an added value to model-based studies or assessments. Both diagnostic and prognostic uses of models will be considered (a description of these is in Chapter 2), and Bayesian tools of anal- ysis will be applied in conjunction with sensitivity analysis. When discussing sensitivity with respect to factors, we shall interpret the term ‘factor’ in a very broad sense: a factor is anything that can be changed in a model prior to its execution. This also includes struc- tural or epistemic sources of uncertainty. To make an example, factors will be presented in applications that are in fact ‘triggers’, used to select one model structure versus another, one mesh size ver- sus another, or altogether different conceptualisations of a system.},

Our main aim is to provide a novel interactive multimedia application that can be used for biomedical education where (a) simulations are combined with tutorials and (b) the presentation layer is simplified while the underlying complexity of the model is retained. The development of the Atlas required the cooperation of many professionals including teachers, system analysts, artists, and programmers. During the design of the Atlas, tools were developed that allow for component-based creation of simulation models, creation of interactive multimedia and their final coordination into a compact unit based on the given design. The Atlas is a freely available online application, which can help to explain the function of individual physiological systems and the causes and symptoms of their disorders.},

abstract = {Many-task computing aims to bridge the gap between two computing paradigms, high throughput computing and high performance computing. Many task computing differs from high throughput computing in the emphasis of using large number of computing resources over short periods of time to accomplish many computational tasks (i.e. including both dependent and independent tasks), where primary metrics are measured in seconds (e.g. FLOPS, tasks/sec, MB/s I/O rates), as opposed to operations (e.g. jobs) per month. Many task computing denotes high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled via file system operations. Tasks may be small or large, uniprocessor or multiprocessor, compute-intensive or data-intensive. The set of tasks may be static or dynamic, homogeneous or heterogeneous, loosely coupled or tightly coupled. The aggregate number of tasks, quantity of computing, and volumes of data may be extremely large. Many task computing includes loosely coupled applications that are generally communication-intensive but not naturally expressed using standard message passing interface commonly found in high performance computing, drawing attention to the many computations that are heterogeneous but not ldquohappilyrdquo parallel.},

abstract = {Progress in our understanding of brain disorders increasingly relies on the costly collection of large standardized brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. Moreover, the clinical interpretation of brain scans benefits from compare and contrast analyses of scans from patients with similar, and sometimes rare, demographic, diagnostic, and treatment status. A solution to both needs is to acquire standardized, research-ready clinical brain scans and to build the information technology infrastructure to share such scans, along with other pertinent information, across hospitals. This paper describes the design, deployment, and operation of a federated imaging system that captures and shares standardized, de-identified clinical brain images in a federation across multiple institutions. In addition to describing innovative aspects of the system architecture and our initial testing of the deployed infrastructure, we also describe the Standardized Imaging Protocol (SIP) developed for the project and our interactions with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) regarding handling patient data in the federated environment.},

abstract = {The acute response of parathyroid hormone to perturbations in serum ionized calcium ([Ca(2+)]) is physiologically complex, and poorly understood. The literature provides numerous observations of quantitative and qualitative descriptions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) dynamics. We present a physiologically based mathematical model of PTH secretion constructed from mechanisms suggested in the literature, and validated against complex [Ca(2+)] clamping protocols from human data. The model is based on two assumptions. The first is that secretion is a fraction of cellular reserves, with the fraction being determined by the kinetics of [Ca(2+)] with its receptor. The second is that there are multiple distinct populations of parathyroid cells, with different secretory parameters. The steady state and transient PTH secretion responses of the model are in agreement with human experimental PTH responses to different hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia stimuli. This mathematical model suggests that a population of secreting cells is responsible for the PTH secretory dynamics observed experimentally.},

abstract = {Many-task computing aims to bridge the gap between two computing paradigms, high throughput computing and high performance computing. Many task computing denotes high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled via file system operations. The aggregate number of tasks, quantity of computing, and volumes of data may be extremely large. Traditional techniques to support many-task computing commonly found in scientific computing (i.e. the reliance on parallel file systems with static configurations) do not scale to today’s largest systems for data intensive application, as the rate of increase in the number of processors per system is outgrowing the rate of performance increase of parallel file systems. We argue that in such circumstances, data locality is critical to the successful and efficient use of large distributed systems for data-intensive applications. We propose a “data diffusion” approach to enable data- intensive many-task computing. Data diffusion acquires compute and storage resources dynamically, replicates data in response to demand, and schedules computations close to data, effectively harnessing data locality in application data access patterns. As demand increases, more resources are acquired, thus allowing faster response to subsequent requests that refer to the same data; when demand drops, resources are released. To explore the feasibility of data diffusion, we offer both a theoretical and empirical analysis. We define an abstract model for data diffusion, define and implement scheduling policies with heuristics that optimize real world performance, and develop a competitive online caching eviction policy. We also offer many empirical experiments to explore the benefits of data diffusion, both under static and dynamic resource provisioning. We show performance improvements of one to two orders of magnitude across three diverse workloads when compared to the performance of parallel file systems with throughputs approaching 80Gb/s on a modest cluster of 200 processors. We also compare data diffusion with a best model for active storage, contrasting the difference between a pull-model found in data diffusion and a push-model found in active storage, on up to 5832 processors. We conclude the chapter with performance results from a large scale astronomy application demonstrating that our approach improves both its performance and scalability.},

abstract = { The GridFTP extensions to the File Transfer Protocol define a general-purpose mechanism for secure, reliable, high-performance data movement. We report here on the Globus striped GridFTP framework, a set of client and server libraries designed to support the construction of data-intensive tools and applications. We describe the design of both this framework and a striped GridFTP server constructed within the framework. We show that this server is faster than other FTP servers in both single-process and striped configurations, achieving, for example, speeds of 27.3 Gbit/s memory-to-memory and 17 Gbit/s disk-to-disk over a 60 millisecond round trip time, 30 Gbit/s network. In another experiment, we show that the server can support 1800 concurrent clients without excessive load. We argue that this combination of performance and modular structure make the Globus GridFTP framework both a good foundation on which to build tools and applications, and a unique testbed for the study of innovative data management techniques and network protocols.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Innovative technologies to deliver health care across borders have attracted both evangelists and sceptics. Our aim was to systematically identify factors that hinder or support implementation of cross-border telemedicine services worldwide in the last two decades. METHODS: Two reviewers independently searched ten databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE, in June 2011 including citations from 1990 onwards when at least an abstract was available in English. We also searched ELDIS and INTUTE databases and Internet search engines to identify grey literature. We included studies which (a) described the use of telemedicine to deliver cross-border healthcare and, or (b) described the factors that hinder or support implementation of cross-border telemedicine services. All study designs were included. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts of articles identified. Papers were allocated to one of four reviewers who extracted relevant data and validated it. We took a qualitative approach to the analysis, conducting a narrative synthesis of the evidence. RESULTS: 6026 records were identified of which 5806 were excluded following screening of titles and abstracts. We assessed 227 full text articles, excluding 133 because they were fatally flawed or did not meet the inclusion criteria, producing a final sample of 94. They involved 76 countries worldwide, most involving collaborations between high and low or middle income countries. Most described services delivering a combination of types of telemedicine but specialties most represented were telepathology, telesurgery, Emergency and trauma telemedicine and teleradiology. Most link health professionals, with only a few linking professionals directly to patients. A main driver for the development of cross-border telemedicine is the need to improve access to specialist services in low and middle income countries and in underserved rural areas in high income countries. Factors that hinder or support implementation clustered into four main themes: (1) legal factors; (2) sustainability factors; (3) cultural factors; and (4) contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: National telemedicine programmes may build infrastructure and change mindsets, laying the foundations for successful engagement in cross-border services. Regional networks can also help with sharing of expertise and innovative ways of overcoming barriers to the implementation of services. Strong team leadership, training, flexible and locally responsive services delivered at low cost, using simple technologies, and within a clear legal and regulatory framework, are all important factors for the successful implementation of cross-border telemedicine services.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Current left ventricular assist devices are designed to provide full hemodynamic support for patients with end-stage failing hearts, but their use has been limited by operative risks, low reliability, and device-related morbidity. Such concerns have resulted in minimum use of left ventricular assist devices for destination therapy. We hypothesize that partial circulatory support, which could be achieved with small pumps implanted with less-invasive procedures, might expand the role of circulatory support devices for treatment of heart failure. METHODS: We examine the hemodynamic effects of partial left ventricular support using a previously described computational model of the cardiovascular system. Results from simulations were validated by comparison with an in vivo hemodynamic study. RESULTS: Simulations demonstrated that partial support (2-3 L/min) increased total cardiac output (left ventricular assist device output plus native heart output) by more than 1 L/min and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure by 7 to 10 mm Hg with moderate-to-severe heart failure. Analyses showed that the hemodynamic benefits of increased cardiac output and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure are greater in less-dilated and less-dysfunctional hearts. Both the relationships between ventricular assist device flow and cardiac output and ventricular assist device flow and left atrial pressure predicted by the model closely approximated the same relationships obtained during hemodynamic study in a bovine heart failure model. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a pump with a flow rate of 2 to 3 L/min could meaningfully affect cardiac output and blood pressure in patients with advanced compensated heart failure. The development of small devices capable of high reliability and minimal complications that can be implanted with less-invasive techniques is supported by these findings.},

abstract = {This study is concerned with the formulation of a 'kidney module' linked to the plasma compartment of a larger mathematical model previously developed. Combined, these models can be used to predict, amongst other things, fluid and small ion excretion rates by the kidney; information that should prove useful in evaluating values and trends related to whole-body fluid balance for different clinical conditions to establish fluid administration protocols and for educational purposes. The renal module assumes first-order, negative-feedback responses of the kidney to changes in plasma volume and/or plasma sodium content from their normal physiological set points. Direct hormonal influences are not explicitly formulated in this empiric model. The model also considers that the renal excretion rates of small ions other than sodium are proportional to the excretion rate of sodium. As part of the model development two aspects are emphasized (1): the estimation of parameters related to the renal elimination of fluid and small ions, and (2) model validation via comparisons between the model predictions and selected experimental data. For validation, model predictions of the renal dynamics are compared with new experimental data for two cases: plasma overload resulting from external fluid infusion (e.g. infusions of iso-osmolar solutions and/or hypertonic/hyperoncotic saline solutions), and untreated hypo volemic conditions that result from the external loss of blood. The present study demonstrates that the empiric kidney module presented above can provide good short-term predictions with respect to all renal outputs considered here. Physiological implications of the model are also presented.},

abstract = {Teleradiology aims to even radiologists' workload, ensure on-call services, reduce waiting lists, consult other specialists and cut costs. Cross-border teleradiology widens this scope beyond the country borders. However, the new service should not reduce the quality of radiology. Quality and trust are key factors in establishment of teleradiology. Additionally there are organizational, technical, legal, security and linguistic issues influencing the service. Herein, we have used experiences from two partially European Union funded telemedicine projects to evaluate factors affecting cross-border teleradiology. Clinical partners from Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania and the Netherlands went through 649 radiology test cases in two different teleradiology projects to build trust and agree about the report structure. Technical set-up was established using secure Internet data transfer, streaming technology, integration of workflows and creating structured reporting tool to overcome language barriers. The biggest barrier to overcome in cross-border teleradiology was the language issue. Establishment of the service was technically and semantically successful but limited to knee and hip X-ray examinations only because the structured reporting tool did not cover any other anatomical regions yet. Special attention has to be paid to clinical quality and trust between partners in cross-border teleradiology. Our experience shows that it is achievable. Legal, security and financial aspects are not covered in this paper because today they differ country by country. There is however an European Union level harmonization process started to enable cross-border eHealth in general.},

abstract = {With the advent of Grid and application technologies, scientists and engineers are building more and more complex applications to manage and process large data sets, and execute scientific experiments on distributed resources. Such application scenarios require means for composing and executing complex workflows. Therefore, many efforts have been made towards the development of workflow management systems for Grid computing. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy that characterizes and classifies various approaches for building and executing workflows on Grids. The taxonomy not only highlights the design and engineering similarities and differences of state-of-the-art in Grid workflow systems, but also identifies the areas that need further research.},

We recommend using abstract components on a distinct physical level, separating the model into hydraulic components, subsystems of the cardiovascular system and individual subsystems of the control mechanism and scenario. We recommend utilizing an acausal modeling feature of Modelica language, which allows model variables to be expressed declaratively. Furthermore, the Modelica tool identifies which are the dependent and independent variables upon compilation. An example of our approach is introduced on several elementary components representing the hydraulic resistance to fluid flow and the elastic response of the vessel, among others. The introduced model implementation can be more reusable and understandable for the general scientific community.},

The authors compare MI and BI along several dimensions, including: (1) historical development of the disciplines, (2) their scientific foundations, (3) data quality and analysis, (4) integration of knowledge and databases, (5) informatics tools to support practice, (6) informatics methods to support research (signal processing, imaging and vision, and computational modeling, (7) professional and patient continuing education, and (8) education and training. It is pointed out that, while the two disciplines differ in their histories, scientific foundations, and methodologic approaches to research in various areas, they nevertheless share methods and tools, which provides a basis for exchange of experience in their different applications. MI expertise in developing health care applications and the strength of BI in biological "discovery science" complement each other well. The new field of biomedical informatics (BMI) holds great promise for developing informatics methods that will be crucial in the development of genomic medicine. The future of BMI will be influenced strongly by whether significant advances in clinical practice and biomedical research come about from separate efforts in MI and BI, or from emerging, hybrid informatics subdisciplines at their interface.},

@book{Butenhof1997,
abstract = {With this practical book, you will attain a solid understanding of threads and will discover how to put this powerful mode of programming to work in real-world applications. The primary advantage of threaded programming is that it enables your applications to accomplish more than one task at the same time by using the number-crunching power of multiprocessor parallelism and by automatically exploiting I/O concurrency in your code, even on a single processor machine. The result: applications that are faster, more responsive to users, and often easier to maintain. Threaded programming is particularly well suited to network programming where it helps alleviate the bottleneck of slow network I/O. This book offers an in-depth description of the IEEE operating system interface standard, POSIXAE (Portable Operating System Interface) threads, commonly called Pthreads. Written for experienced C programmers, but assuming no previous knowledge of threads, the book explains basic concepts such as asynchronous programming, the lifecycle of a thread, and synchronization. You then move to more advanced topics such as attributes objects, thread-specific data, and realtime scheduling. An entire chapter is devoted to "real code," with a look at barriers, read/write locks, the work queue manager, and how to utilize existing libraries. In addition, the book tackles one of the thorniest problems faced by thread programmers-debugging-with valuable suggestions on how to avoid code errors and performance problems from the outset. Numerous annotated examples are used to illustrate real-world concepts. A Pthreads mini-reference and a look at future standardization are also included.},

abstract = {A new global optimization algorithm, dynamically dimensioned search (DDS), is introduced for automatic calibration of watershed simulation models. DDS is designed for calibration problems with many parameters, requires no algorithm parameter tuning, and automatically scales the search to find good solutions within the maximum number of user-specified function (or model) evaluations. As a result, DDS is ideally suited for computationally expensive optimization problems such as distributed watershed model calibration. DDS performance is compared to the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm for multiple optimization test functions as well as real and synthetic SWAT2000 model automatic calibration formulations. Algorithms are compared for optimization problems ranging from 6 to 30 dimensions, and each problem is solved in 1000 to 10,000 total function evaluations per optimization trial. Results are presented so that future modelers can assess algorithm performance at a computational scale relevant to their modeling case study. In all four of the computationally expensive real SWAT2000 calibration formulations considered here (14, 14, 26, and 30 calibration parameters), results show DDS to be more efficient and effective than SCE. In two cases, DDS requires only 15–20\% of the number of model evaluations used by SCE in order to find equally good values of the objective function. Overall, the results also show that DDS rapidly converges to good calibration solutions and easily avoids poor local optima. The simplicity of the DDS algorithm allows for easy recoding and subsequent adoption into any watershed modeling application framework.},

The VPH Network of Excellence (NoE) has been set up to help develop common standards, open source software, freely accessible data and model repositories, and various training and dissemination activities for the project. It is also working to coordinate the many clinically targeted projects that have been funded under the FP7 calls. An initial vision for the VPH was defined by the FP6 STEP project in 2006. In 2010, we wrote an assessment of the accomplishments of the first two years of the VPH in which we considered the biomedical science, healthcare and information and communications technology challenges facing the project (Hunter et al. 2010 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 368, 2595–2614 (doi:10.1098/rsta.2010.0048)). We proposed that a not-for-profit professional umbrella organization, the VPH Institute, should be established as a means of sustaining the VPH vision beyond the time-frame of the NoE. Here, we update and extend this assessment and in particular address the following issues raised in response to Hunter et al.: (i) a vision for the VPH updated in the light of progress made so far, (ii) biomedical science and healthcare challenges that the VPH initiative can address while also providing innovation opportunities for the European industry, and (iii) external changes needed in regulatory policy and business models to realize the full potential that the VPH has to offer to industry, clinics and society generally. virtual physiological humanphysiomecomputational physiologysystems biologymultiscale modellingFootnotesOne contribution of 25 to a Theme Issue ‘The virtual physiological human: integrative approaches to computational biomedicine’.© 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

It explained aortic pressure decay in diastole, but fell short in systole. Therefore characteristic impedance was introduced as a third element of the Windkessel model. Characteristic impedance links the lumped Windkessel to transmission phenomena (e.g., wave travel). Windkessels are used as hydraulic load for isolated hearts and in studies of the entire circulation. Furthermore, they are used to estimate total arterial compliance from pressure and flow; several of these methods are reviewed. Windkessels describe the general features of the input impedance, with physiologically interpretable parameters. Since it is a lumped model it is not suitable for the assessment of spatially distributed phenomena and aspects of wave travel, but it is a simple and fairly accurate approximation of ventricular afterload.},

@book{Fowler2003,
abstract = {The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology-from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET-the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.},

abstract = {The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard defines Radiology medical device interoperability and image data exchange between modalities, image databases - Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) - and image review end-points. However the scope of DICOM and PACS technology is currently limited to the trusted and static environment of the hospital. In order to meet the demand for ad-hoc tele-radiology and image guided medical procedures within the global healthcare enterprise, a new technology must provide mobility, security, flexible scale of operations, and rapid responsiveness for DICOM medical devices and subsequently medical image data. Grid technology, an informatics approach to securely federate independently operated computing, storage, and data management resources at the global scale over public networks, meets these core requirements. Here we present an approach to federate DICOM and PACS devices for large-scale medical image workflows within a global healthcare enterprise. The Globus MEDICUS (Medical Imaging and Computing for Unified Information Sharing) project uses the standards-based Globus Toolkit Grid infrastructure to vertically integrate a new service for DICOM devices - the DICOM Grid Interface Service (DGIS). This new service translates between DICOM and Grid operations and thus transparently extends DICOM to Globus based Grid infrastructure. This Grid image workflow paradigm has been designed to provide not only solutions for global image communication, but fault-tolerance and disaster recovery using Grid data replication technology. Actual use-case of 40 MEDICUS Grid connected international hospitals of the Childerns Oncology Group and the Neuroblastoma Cancer Foundation and further clinical applications are discussed.

Innovations such as Hyper-Threading Technology, HyperTransport Technology, and multicore microprocessors from IBM, Intel, and Sun are accelerating the movement's growth. Only one thing is missing: programmers with the skills to meet the soaring demand for parallel software. That's where Patterns for Parallel Programming comes in. It's the first parallel programming guide written specifically to serve working software developers, not just computer scientists. The authors introduce a complete, highly accessible pattern language that will help any experienced developer "think parallel"-and start writing effective parallel code almost immediately. Instead of formal theory, they deliver proven solutions to the challenges faced by parallel programmers, and pragmatic guidance for using today's parallel APIs in the real world. Coverage includes: Understanding the parallel computing landscape and the challenges faced by parallel developers Finding the concurrency in a software design problem and decomposing it into concurrent tasks Managing the use of data across tasks Creating an algorithm structure that effectively exploits the concurrency you've identified Connecting your algorithmic structures to the APIs needed to implement them Specific software constructs for implementing parallel programs Working with today's leading parallel programming environments: OpenMP, MPI, and Java Patterns have helped thousands of programmers master object-oriented development and other complex programming technologies. With this book, you will learn that they're the best way to master parallel programming too.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Kymographic imaging through videokymography has been recognized as a convenient, novel way to display laryngeal behavior, yet little systematic research has been done to map the relevant features displayed in such images. Here we have aimed at specification of these features to enable systematic visual characterization and categorization of vocal fold vibratory patterns in voice disorders.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. We selected 45 subjects and extracted 100 videokymographic images from the archive of more than 7,000 videokymographic examinations of subjects with a wide range of voice disorders. The images showed a large variety of vocal fold vibratory behaviors during sustained phonations. We visually identified the prominent features that distinguished the vibration patterns across the images.

RESULTS: We divided the findings into 10 feature categories. They included refined traditional features (eg, mucosal waves), as well as additional features that are obscured in strobolaryngoscopy (eg, different types of irregularities, left-right frequency differences, shapes of lateral and medial peaks, cycle aberrations).

CONCLUSIONS: The variations in the identified features reveal different behavioral origins of voice disorders. The findings open new possibilities for objective documentation and for monitoring vocal fold behavior in clinical practice through kymographic imaging.},

abstract = {Programming languages evolve just as natural languages do, driven by human desires to express thoughts more cleverly, succinctly, or elegantly than in the past. A big difference is the fact that one key receiver of programs is nonhuman. These nonhumans evolve faster than humans do, helping drive language mutation after mutation, andtogether with the human program writers and readersnaturally selecting among the mutations. In the 1970s, vector and parallel computer evolution was on the move. Programming assistance was provided by language extensionsfirst to Fortran and then to Cin the form of directives and pragmas, respectively. Vendors differentiated themselves by providing better extensions than did their competitors; and by the mid-1980s things had gotten out of hand for software vendors. At Kuck and Associates (KAI), we had the problem of dealing with the whole industry, so Bruce Leasure and I set out to fix things by forming an industrywide committee, the Parallel Computing Forum (PCF). PCF struck a nerve and became very active. In a few years we had a draft standard that we took through ANSI, and after a few more years it became the ANSI X3.H5 draft. Our stamina gave out before it became an official ANSI standard, but the industry paid attention, and extensions evolved more uniformly. This situation lasted for a few years, but the 1980s were a golden era for parallel architectural evolution, with many people writing parallel programs, so extensions again diverged, and programming needs grew. KAI took on the challenge of rethinking things and defining parallel profiling and correctness-checking tools at the same time, with the goal of innovative software development products. By the mid-1990s we had made a lot of progress and had discussed it a bit with some hardware vendors. When SGI bought Cray in April 1996, they had an immediate directive problem (two distinct extensions) and approached us about working with them. Together we refined what we had, opened up to the industry, and formed the Architecture Review Board (ARB). OpenMP was born 18 months later, as the New York Times reported:},

abstract = {Grid interoperability has recently become a major issue at Grid forums. Most of the current ideas try to solve the problem at the middleware level where unfortunately too many components (information system, broker, etc.) should be made interoperable. As an alternative concept the P-GRADE portal is the first Grid portal that tries to solve the problem at the level of workflows. It means that the components of a workflow can be executed simultaneously in several Grids. In this way the user can exploit more parallelism than inside one Grid. More than that the workflow level completely hides the low level Grid details for the end-user who does not have to learn the low level Grid commands of different Grids. In this way porting workflow application between different Grids can be done with minimal user efforts. The paper describes those features and techniques that are provided and used by the P-GRADE portal to solve the Grid interoperability problem. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

From working in a scientific computing center, the authors gained a unique perspective on the requirements and attitudes of users as well as manufacturers of parallel computers. The text first introduces the architecture of modern cache-based microprocessors and discusses their inherent performance limitations, before describing general optimization strategies for serial code on cache-based architectures. It next covers shared- and distributed-memory parallel computer architectures and the most relevant network topologies. After discussing parallel computing on a theoretical level, the authors show how to avoid or ameliorate typical performance problems connected with OpenMP. They then present cache-coherent nonuniform memory access (ccNUMA) optimization techniques, examine distributed-memory parallel programming with message passing interface (MPI), and explain how to write efficient MPI code. The final chapter focuses on hybrid programming with MPI and OpenMP. Users of high performance computers often have no idea what factors limit time to solution and whether it makes sense to think about optimization at all. This book facilitates an intuitive understanding of performance limitations without relying on heavy computer science knowledge. It also prepares readers for studying more advanced literature.},

abstract = {Elastance-resistance [E(t)-R] representations of the left ventricle (LV) were evaluated for their ability to reproduce instantaneous pressure [P(t)] and outflow [Q(t)]. Experiments were performed in open-chest rats. P(t) and Q(t) were measured during steady-state ejecting beats and during a beat in which the aorta was suddenly clamped. The degree of clamping varied from partial to total occlusion. The total occlusion beat was considered an isovolumic beat that generated an isovolumic pressure [Piso(t)] with a characteristic time to maximal Piso(t) [Tpisomax]. In ejecting beats, 34\% of stroke volume was delivered after Tpisomax. P(t) and Q(t) from the steady-state ejecting beats and Piso(t) from the clamped beat were then used to estimate parameters of an E(t)-R model. Components of P(t) and Q(t) not accounted for by E(t)-R were identified and termed extra-pressure [Pext(t)] and extra-outflow [Qext(t)]. Pext(t) and Qext(t) were near-zero valued until Tpisomax; then they became systematically positive and finally negative valued after end ejection. During partial aortic occlusion, P(t) was elevated and Q(t) was reduced. However, the time of ejection was extended, and the fraction of stroke volume delivered after Tpisomax increased as P(t) was made higher. Partial occlusion also prolonged the positive phase of Pext(t) and Qext(t). Elements possessing "active" and "deactive" properties were added to the E(t)-R model in an attempt to account for Pext(t) and Qext(t) during partial occlusion. Optional forms of these elements were considered. These expanded E(t)-R models were fitted to basal ejecting data and then asked to predict data from a partial occlusion beat. All expanded models failed to adequately predict the partial occlusion pressure and/or outflow. It was concluded that 1) late ejection was quantitatively important to LV pumping, 2) behavior during late ejection was inconsistent with E(t)-R, and 3) ad hoc modification of E(t)-R models was not likely to yield LV pumping models that could satisfactorily reproduce instantaneous P(t) and Q(t) behavior over the entire ejection period.},

In this paper, we introduce a Java-based utility capable of performing model simulation, identifiability analysis, and parameter optimization of ionic cardiac cell models written in CellML. Identifiability analysis was performed in seven CellML models. Parameter identifiability was consistently improved by using the compensatory membrane current as opposed to the membrane voltage as the residual. as well as through the introduction of an additional stimulus set used in the fitting process.},

In contrast, the engineering sciences, from a detailed knowledge of its components, have successfully explained how a plane actually flies. The key difference is the use of mathematical models based on physical principles and a systematic approach to knowledge management. In this review, we describe the efforts of the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) Physiome Project to address the challenge of integrating molecular, cellular and tissue/organ structure and function through the use of multiscale modeling based on the development of community standards, open source tools and web-accessible databases. We illustrate two applications of the framework, one to cardiology and one to bone fracture prediction in the elderly. </para>},

Institutes, departments, and centers of various flavors of Systems Biology have sprung up all over the world. An Internet search now produces more than 2 million hits. Of the 2,800 entries in PubMed with "Systems Biology" in either the title or the abstract, only two papers were published before 2000, and >90\% were published in the past five years. In this article, we interpret Systems Biology as an approach rather than as a field or a destination of research. We illustrate that this approach is productive for the exploration of systems behavior, or "phenotypes," at all levels of structural and functional complexity, explicitly including the supracellular domain, and suggest how this may be related conceptually to genomes and biochemical networks. We discuss the role of models in Systems Biology and conclude with a consideration of their utility in biomedical research and development.},

abstract = {This book's introduction features a humorous story of a man with a line of people behind him, who explains to his boss, "I can't find an efficient algorithm, but neither can all these famous people." This man illustrates an important quality of a class of problems, namely, the NP-complete problems: if you can prove that a problem is in this class, then it has no known polynomial-time solution that is guaranteed to work in general. This quality implies that the problem is difficult to deal with in practice. The focus of this book is to teach the reader how to identify, deal with, and understand the essence of NP-complete problems; Computers and Intractability does all of those things effectively. In a readable yet mathematically rigorous manner, the book covers topics such as how to prove that a given problem is NP-complete and how to cope with NP-complete problems. (There is even a chapter on advanced topics, with numerous references.) Computers and Intractability also contains a list of more than 300 problems-most of which are known to be NP-complete-with comments and references.},

abstract = {Coarctation of the aorta (CoA), is a congenital defect characterized by a severe narrowing of the aorta, usually distal to the aortic arch. The treatment options include surgical repair, stent implantation, and balloon angioplasty. In order to evaluate the physiological significance of the pre-operative coarctation and to assess the post-operative results, the hemodynamic analysis is usually performed by measuring the pressure gradient (deltaP) across the coarctation site via invasive cardiac catheterization. The measure of success is reduction of the (deltaP > 20 mmHg) systolic blood pressure gradient. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive method based on Computational Fluid Dynamics and MR imaging to estimate the pre- and post-operative hemodynamics for both native and recurrent coarctation patients. High correlation of our results and catheter measurements is shown on corresponding pre- and post-operative examination of 5 CoA patients.},

abstract = {The modeling of physiological systems via mathematical equations reflects the calculation procedure more than the structure of the real system modeled, with the simulation environment SIMULINK™ being one of the best suited to this strategy. Nevertheless, object-oriented modeling is spreading in current simulation environments through the use of the individual components of the model and its interconnections to define the underlying dynamic equations. In this paper we describe the use of the SIMSCAPE™ simulation environment in the object-oriented modeling of the closed loop cardiovascular system. The described approach represents a valuable tool in the teaching of physiology for graduate medical students.},

@article{Hester2011systems,
abstract = {Over the last 10 years, 'Systems Biology' has focused on the integration of biology and medicine with information technology and computation. The current challenge is to use the discoveries of the last 20 years, such as genomics and proteomics, to develop targeted therapeutical strategies. These strategies are the result of understanding the aetiologies of complex diseases. Scientists predict the data will make personalized medicine rapidly available. However, the data need to be considered as a highly complex system comprising multiple inputs and feedback mechanisms. Translational medicine requires the functional and conceptual linkage of genetics to proteins, proteins to cells, cells to organs, organs to systems and systems to the organism. To help understand the complex integration of these systems, a mathematical model of the entire human body, which accurately links the functioning of all organs and systems together, could provide a framework for the development and testing of new hypotheses that will be important in clinical outcomes. There are several efforts to develop a 'Human Physiome', with the strengths and weaknesses of each being presented here. The development of a 'Human Model', with verification, documentation and validation of the underlying and integrative responses, is essential to provide a usable environment. Future development of a 'Human Model' requires integrative physiologists working in collaboration with other scientists, who have expertise in all areas of human biology, to develop the most accurate and usable human model.},

abstract = {We have previously shown in the normally ejecting canine left ventricle that E(t), the time-varying ratio of instantaneous pressure, P(t), to instantaneous volume, V(t), is little affected by end-diastolic volume or aortic pressure. The present study on an excised, supported canine heart preparation indicates that the thesis on E(t) is also valid for either totally isovolumic or auxobaric beats. Intraventricular volume was measured more accurately than it was in the previous study by a new volumetric system. Regression analysis of the data showed that the instantaneous pressure-volume relationship could be approximated by the equation P(t) = E(t).[V(t) - Vd], where Vd is an empirical constant, over a wide range of intraventricular volume. Similar E(t) curves were obtained from both isovolumic and auxobaric beats for a given contractile state. When the contractile state of the preparation was enhanced by a constant-rate infusion (0.2 \{micro\}g/min) of norepinephrine or isoproterenol into the coronary artery, the peak magnitude of E(t) increased 63\% from 3.6 mm Hg/ml and the time to peak E(t) shortened 10\% from 175 msec. We conclude that the present investigation substantiates our earlier study which established a link between E(t) and the contractile state of the heart.},

abstract = {The use of contrast agents and tracers in medical imaging has a long history. They provide important information for diagnosis and therapy, but for some desired applications, a higher resolution is required than can be obtained using the currently available medical imaging techniques. Consider, for example, the use of magnetic tracers in magnetic resonance imaging: detection thresholds for in vitro and in vivo imaging are such that the background signal from the host tissue is a crucial limiting factor. A sensitive method for detecting the magnetic particles directly is to measure their magnetic fields using relaxometry; but this approach has the drawback that the inverse problem (associated with transforming the data into a spatial image) is ill posed and therefore yields low spatial resolution. Here we present a method for obtaining a high-resolution image of such tracers that takes advantage of the nonlinear magnetization curve of small magnetic particles. Initial 'phantom' experiments are reported that demonstrate the feasibility of the imaging method. The resolution that we achieve is already well below 1 mm. We evaluate the prospects for further improvement, and show that the method has the potential to be developed into an imaging method characterized by both high spatial resolution as well as high sensitivity.},

This study was designed to assess the effects of vocal training for singers over a period of nine months. Phonetogram contour changes were examined, with the primary focus on expansion of frequency range and/or intensity control. Twenty-one first-year, master's level, vocal music students, who were engaged in an intensive vocal performance curriculum, participated in this study. Following nine months of vocal training, significant differences were revealed in the subjects' mean frequency range and minimum vocal intensity across frequency levels. There was no significant difference for the mean maximum vocal intensity across frequency levels following vocal training.},

abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book: Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials. Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls. Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications. Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds. Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging. 2008 John Wiley \{\&\} Sons, Ltd.},

Such application scenarios require means for composing and executing complex workflows. Therefore, many efforts have been made towards the development of workflow management systems for Grid computing. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy that characterizes and classifies various approaches for building and executing workflows on Grids. We also survey several representative Grid workflow systems developed by various projects world-wide to demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the taxonomy. The taxonomy not only highlights the design and engineering similarities and differences of state-of-the-art in Grid workflow systems, but also identifies the areas that need further research.},

Three different methods of parallel FFT are presented. One is the reference parallel FFT for comparison, and the other two with well-distributed computation as well as reduced communication overhead. By evenly distributing parallel computation tasks which uses data locality, the execution time for completing each stage of FFT can be reduced. Moreover, by optimizing data exchanges we minimize the communication overhead. Depending on the communication regularity, one can select appropriate parallel FFT algorithm. By using the simulation results of our cycle-accurate SystemC NoC model with a parameterizable 2-D mesh architecture, and the performance analysis in time as well as complexity, our proposed algorithms are shown to outperform other parallel FFT algorithm or high-speed DSP implementations.},

abstract = {The time-varying elastance theory of Suga et al. is widely used to simulate left ventricular function in mathematical models and in contemporary in vitro models. We investigated the validity of this theory in the presence of a left ventricular assist device. Left ventricular pressure and volume data are presented that demonstrate the heart-device interaction for a positive-displacement pump (Novacor) and a rotary blood pump (Medos). The Novacor was implanted in a calf and used in fixed-rate mode (85 BPM), whereas the Medos was used at several flow levels (0-3 l/min) in seven healthy sheep. The Novacor data display high beat-to-beat variations in the amplitude of the elastance curve, and the normalized curves deviate strongly from the typical bovine curve. The Medos data show how the maximum elastance depends on the pump flow level. We conclude that the original time-varying elastance theory insufficiently models the complex hemodynamic behavior of a left ventricle that is mechanically assisted, and that there is need for an updated ventricular model to simulate the heart-device interaction.},

The whole system was modelled in MODELICA, which uses a hierarchical object-oriented modelling strategy, under the DYMOLA simulation environment. The performance of the controlled system was analysed by simulation in light of the existing hypothesis and validation tests previously performed with physiological data, demonstrating the effectiveness of both regulation mechanisms under physiological and pathological conditions.},

@article{Raicu2010,
abstract = {Many-task computing aims to bridge the gap between two computing paradigms, high throughput computing and high performance computing. Many-task computing denotes high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled via file system operations. The aggregate number of tasks, quantity of computing, and volumes of data may be extremely large. Traditional techniques found in production systems in the scientific community to support many-task computing do not scale to today's largest systems, due to issues in local resource manager scalability and granularity, efficient utilization of the raw hardware, long wait queue times, and shared/parallel file system contention and scalability. To address these limitations, we adopted a "top-down" approach to building a middleware called Falkon, to support the most demanding many-task computing applications at the largest scales. Falkon (Fast and Light-weight tasK executiON framework) integrates (1) multi-level scheduling to enable dynamic resource provisioning and minimize wait queue times, (2) a streamlined task dispatcher able to achieve orders-of-magnitude higher task dispatch rates than conventional schedulers, and (3) data diffusion which performs data caching and uses a data-aware scheduler to co-locate computational and storage resources. Micro-benchmarks have shown Falkon to achieve over 15K+ tasks/s throughputs, scale to hundreds of thousands of processors and to millions of queued tasks, and execute billions of tasks per day. Data diffusion has also shown to improve applications scalability and performance, with its ability to achieve hundreds of Gb/s I/O rates on modest sized clusters, with Tb/s I/O rates on the horizon. Falkon has shown orders of magnitude improvements in performance and scalability than traditional approaches to resource management across many diverse workloads and applications at scales of billions of tasks on hundreds of thousands of processors across clusters, specialized systems, Grids, and supercomputers. Falkon's performance and scalability have enabled a new class of applications called Many-Task Computing to operate at previously so-believed impossible scales with high efficiency. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

VNC provides access to home computing environments from anywhere in the world, on whatever computing infrastructure happens to be available-including, for example, public Web browsing terminals in airports. In addition, VNC allows a single desktop to be accessed from several places simultaneously, thus supporting application sharing in the style of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). The technology underlying VNC is a simple remote display protocol. It is the simplicity of this protocol that makes VNC so powerful. Unlike other remote display protocols such as the X Window System and Citrix's ICA, the VNC protocol is totally independent of operating system, windowing system, and applications. The VNC system is freely available for download from the ORL Web site at http://www.orl.co.uk/vnc/. We begin the article by summarizing the evolution of VNC from our work on thin client architectures. We then describe the structure of the VNC protocol, and conclude by discussing the ways we use VNC technology now and how it may evolve further as new clients and servers are developed},

Although researchers from both areas have occasionally collaborated, their training, objectives and interests have been quite different. The results of the Human Genome and related projects have attracted the interest of many professionals, and introduced new challenges that will transform biomedical research and health care. A characteristic of the 'post genomic' era will be to correlate essential genotypic information with expressed phenotypic information. In this context, Biomedical Informatics (BMI) has emerged to describe the technology that brings both disciplines (BI and MI) together to support genomic medicine.

@article{Svec1996,
abstract = {A digital technique for high-speed visualization of vibration, called videokymography, was developed and applied to the vocal folds. The system uses a modified video camera able to work in two modes: high-speed (nearly 8,000 images/s) and standard (50 images/s in CCIR norm). In the high-speed mode, the camera selects one active horizontal line (transverse to the glottis) from the whole laryngeal image. The successive line images are presented in real time on a commercial TV monitor, filling each video frame from top to bottom. The system makes it possible to observe left-right asymmetries, open quotient, propagation of mucosal waves, movement of the upper and, in the closing phase, the lower margins of the vocal folds, etc. The technique is suitable for further processing and quantification of recorded vibration.},

abstract = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the CMB and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the SZ effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derived from CMB data and that derived from SZ data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak.},

abstract = {High Performance Computing: Programming and Applications presents techniques that address new performance issues in the programming of high performance computing (HPC) applications. Omitting tedious details, the book discusses hardware architecture concepts and programming techniques that are the most pertinent to application developers for achieving high performance. Even though the text concentrates on C and Fortran, the techniques described can be applied to other languages, such as C++ and Java. Drawing on their experience with chips from AMD and systems, interconnects, and software from Cray Inc., the authors explore the problems that create bottlenecks in attaining good performance. They cover techniques that pertain to each of the three levels of parallelism: Message passing between the nodes Shared memory parallelism on the nodes or the multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) units on the accelerator Vectorization on the inner level After discussing architectural and software challenges, the book outlines a strategy for porting and optimizing an existing application to a large massively parallel processor (MPP) system. With a look toward the future, it also introduces the use of general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) for carrying out HPC computations. A companion website at www.hybridmulticoreoptimization.com contains all the examples from the book, along with updated timing results on the latest released processors.},

abstract = {Data mining techniques are used in many application areas to extract useful knowledge from large datasets. Very often, parameter sweeping is used in data mining applications to explore the effects produced on the data analysis result by different values of the algorithm parameters. Parameter sweeping applications can be highly computing demanding, since the number of single tasks to be executed increases with the number of swept parameters and the range of their values. Cloud technologies can be effectively exploited to provide end-users with the computing and storage resources, and the execution mechanisms needed to efficiently run this class of applications. In this paper, we present a Data Mining Cloud App framework that supports the execution of parameter sweeping data mining applications on a Cloud. The framework has been implemented using the Windows Azure platform, and evaluated through a set of parameter sweeping clustering and classification applications. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, as well as the scalability that can be achieved through the parallel execution of parameter sweeping applications on a pool of virtual servers.},
